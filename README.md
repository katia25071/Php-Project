Project idea: Developing a Library Management System for Schools/Universities


Problem

Nowadays, almost every school/university owns a physical library, but not all of them use a
proper library management system to catalog all the books and other materials and fulfill the
needs of both students and staff. The idea to create this system came from the actual library
management system that is being used in my university, which most of students don’t even
know it existence. Even though the system is well-designed, it is not very interactive and maybe
a bit difficult to use and understand from both staff and student perspective. These issues can
lead to less engagement in the system, as in our case, and the need for some training to use the
system to upload materials. The system also doesn’t offer student interaction, meaning that the
login option is not functional. This can also lead to inefficiency, as the person managing the
system needs to do more work.

Solution

To address these issues, a simpler, modern and user-friendly Library Management System can
be developed that can be more interactive and easier to use. The system can have more
interaction from students which can register in the system by themselves using the universities,
rather than going to the library physically to register. They can have the opportunity to create
their own account and check books availability. We can also try to make the system simpler for
the person managing it and create a more user-friendly interface.

Aim

The aim is to efficiently manage and organize the school library resources and services, while
providing a positive user experience for students, teachers, and other staff members. It should
provide easy and quick access to library resources, regardless of whether they are physical or
digital, to support teaching, learning, and research activities.


Main objectives

1. To improve user experience by providing an easy-to-use interface that allows both students
and staff to easily search for and access library resources.
2. To create more interaction between the students and the system.
3. To increase the engagement and efficiency of the system.


Description of the Application

The proposed system will be a web-based application that allows students and staff to easily
search for and access library resources. The system will be developed using HTML, CSS,
Bootstrap, JavaScript (Frontend) and php (backend). It will include a user-friendly interface,
student accounts/manager account and features such as: view borrowed books, check-
in/check-out, cataloging books/materials etc. This system will be used to improve the overall
experience of all stakeholder
